Comments:

This is a basic TCP-based communication program that simulates caching HTML
files. It requires that the client and server python scripts be in the same
directory, along with any HTML files you would like to pass

Feel free to pass as many HTML files through the client, given they are located
in the same directory

This will also work on a Chrome Browser, simply enter the url with the server running,
no need for the client in this case

Depending on the scenario, the program will:
- Create a cache file if it is not detected in the directory and cache the
  requested HTML file within it
- Update the cached file should it require to be updated when fetching the HTML
  file from the server

The cache file, called 'cache.txt' is a csv file containing the following
information about each HTML file:

filename, Last-Modification-Time (in %a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z" format)
